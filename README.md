## Description

MinimalCompass is a Blish HUD module designed similarly to Player Unknown Battleground's compasss with a touch of Skyrim's (coming soon).

## Features

- **Minimalist Design:** A compass that should not distract you when playing the game.
- **Smart Visibility:** The compass automatically hides when the in-game map is open to prevent overlap.

## Requirements

- Guild Wars 2
- [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/)

## Installation

1.  **Download:** Get the latest release of MinimalCompass from the [releases page](https://github.com/GW2Seali/MinimalCompass/releases).
2.  **Install:** Place the downloaded `.bhm` file into your Blish HUD `modules` directory.
    - The default location is usually `Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\modules`.
3.  **Enable:** Launch Guild Wars 2 and Blish HUD. The MinimalCompass module should now appear in the module list in Blish HUD. Make sure it is enabled.

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, the compass will automatically appear at the top-center of your screen during gameplay. No further configuration is required.
